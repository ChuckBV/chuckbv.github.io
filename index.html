    <p>My name is Chuck Burks. ChuckBV is a Github username I once came up with by appending my wife's initial after my own. Many would use a GitHub web page as a kind of personal calling card; others would use professional sites such as Google Scholar or ORICID for that purpose.  I reference my pages on those sites immediately below. In short, I study insect pest management of horticultural crops and commodities in my capacity as a research entomologist for the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Fresno County, California. My primary purpose with this site, however, is primarily as a kind of personal cheat sheet and secondly to share these resources with interested parties.</p>

    <p>Internet advice on how to create a web page often starts with "learn HTML, cascading style sheets (CSS). I used HTML around 30 years ago when it was newer and simpler. Currently I am grateful that there are career front edge web designers, but I feel my own time is better used on other things. My favored tool is therefore R Markdown. The basics of markdown can be learned in 15 minutes. I prepare markdown documents on Notepad++. The plugin "Markdown Viewer++" allows me to view and verify the basic document as I prepare it. More purpose-oriented documents are produced within RStudio. The R language and RStudio have become central tools for me in my day job over the last 10-15 years because they are powerful, widely used among my colleagues (i.e., a kind of lingua franca), and the price is right (free for individaul use). (Before that I was a SAS guy, and I still prefer SAS for some things.) A few basic references on these tools are listed below.</p>

    <p>The Github site gets a backdoor mention in the "happygitwithr.com" bullet above. Github was first and primarily designed as a collaborative programming site, but it is also widely used and advocated for sharing data analysis projects with R. One trick with Github it to use it as a low-cost way to host a static web page/site. That trick is being exploited in this present project.</p>
